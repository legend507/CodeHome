Why parseInt(8, 3) -> NaN and parseInt(16, 3) -> 1?


### Answer

This is something people trip over all the time, even when they know about it. :-) You're seeing this for the same reason `parseInt("1abc")`
returns `1`: `parseInt` stops at the first invalid character and returns whatever it has at that point. If there are no valid characters
to parse, it returns `NaN`.

`parseInt(3, 3)` means `"parse "3" in base 3"` (note that it converts the number `3` to a string; details in the spec). But in base `3`, 
the single-digit numbers are just `0, 1, and 2`. It's like asking it to parse "9" in octal. Since there were no valid characters, you got
`NaN`.

`parseInt(16, 3)` is asking it to parse "16" in base `3`. Since it can parse the `1`, it does, and then it stops at the `6` because it
can't parse it. So it returns `1`.
