/*
 Q: Write an efficient function that deletes characters from an ASCII string. Use the prototype
    		string removeChars( string str, string remove );
    where any character existing in remove must be deleted from str. For example,
	given a str of "Battle of the Vowels: Hawaii vs. Grozny" and a remove of
	"aeiou", the function should transform str to “Bttl f th Vwls: Hw vs. Grzny”.
