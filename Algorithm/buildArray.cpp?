 Q: Given array a [n],  Get array b [n] b [i] = a [0] * a [1] ... a [n-2] * a [n-1] / a [i]
    Requirements can not be used to divide
    In addition to traverse the counter with a [N] b [N], do not use the new variable 
    (including stack temporary variables, space and global static variable)
     Space complexity of O (1) time complexity of O (n)
