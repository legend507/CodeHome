/*
Given two words word1 and word2, find the minimum number of steps required to convert word1 to word2 
(each operation is counted as 1 step). You have the following 3 operations permitted on a word:
a) Insert a character
b) Delete a character
c) Replace a character

Thoughts:
First, we explain the recursive structure here. Denote ed(s_{1}, s_{2}) as the edit distance between s_{1} and s_{2}. 
For base case, we have:
ed('', '') = 0
ed('', s) = ed(s, '') = \|s\|
Then, for the recursive step, we have:
ed(s_{1}+ch1, s_{2}+ch2) = ed(s_{1}, s_{2}) if ch1 == ch2 
since we donâ€™t need to anything from s_{1},s_{2} to s_{1}+ch1, s_{2}+ch2.
ed(s_{1}+ch1, s_{2}+ch2) = \min(1 + ed(s_{1}, s_{2}), 1 + ed(s_{1}+ch1, s_{2}), 1 + ed(s_{1}, s_{2}+ch2))
if ch1 != ch2. 
Here we compare three options:
Replace ch1 with ch2, hence 1 + ed(s_{1}, s_{2}).
Insert ch2 into s_{2}, hence 1 + ed(s_{1}+ch1, s_{2}).
Delete ch1 from s_{1}, hence 1 + ed(s_{1}, s_{2}+ch2).
