Secretary Problem
=========

The secretary problem is one of many names for a famous problem of the optimal stopping theory

The problem has an elegant solution. The optimal stopping rule prescribes always rejecting the first n/e applicants 
after the interview (where e is the base of the natural logarithm) and then stopping at the first applicant 
who is better than every applicant interviewed so far (or continuing to the last applicant if this never occurs). 
Sometimes this strategy is called the 1/e stopping rule, because the probability of stopping at the best applicant 
with this strategy is about 1/e already for moderate values of n. One reason why the secretary problem has received
so much attention is that the optimal policy for the problem (the stopping rule) is simple and
selects the single best candidate about 37% of the time, irrespective of whether there are 100 or 100 million applicants. 
In fact, for any value of n the probability of selecting the best candidate when using the optimal policy is at least 1/e.
