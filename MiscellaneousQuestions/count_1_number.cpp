Deduction: 
For high bit is 1 and the other bits are 0, the numbers of 1 is equal to 1 + (m-1)*(2^(m-2)), m is the bits of n. 
And the high bit is ascending order from 1, thus the numbers of 1 in the high bit is (n mod 2^m).

We can get the formula f(N) = f(N mod 2^m) + 1 + (N mod 2^m) + (m-1)*2^(m-2).
                       f(1) = 1
